    " - while writing your solution, **make at least 5 separate commits** with real comments (we will check history)\n",

    " - push your final version before 5:00pm Wednesday, and send `ucbpythonclass+seminar@gmail.com` an email explaining exactly how to clone it\n",

    "2) Write a module called ‘CalCalc’, with a method called ‘calculate’ that evaluates any string passed to it, and can be used from either the command line (using argparse with reasonable flags) or imported within Python. Feel free to use something like eval(), but be aware of some of the nasty things it can do, and make sure it doesn’t have too much power:  http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201206/eval_really_is_dangerous.html\n",
